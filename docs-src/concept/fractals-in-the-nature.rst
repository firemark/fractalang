Fractals in the nature
======================

Fractals of course are a great mathematics category that is possible to measure
fractals or describe mathematically, but it's possible to seek fractals in nature?

The answer is *of course!* The first examples are based on `Allometric Scaling laws`_ and
`Internal transport systems`_ are fractals and very similar and self-similar. Look at
a tree - starts on a trunk, divided into branches, next into twigs, and finally into leaves.
The twigs are the thinnest stems and the trunk is the thickest stem. That is because
this is `the optimal transport`_ of energy. The next similar example is `the lungs`_ -
start on the trachea and divided it into bronchitis. The other examples are rivers,
lightning bolts, and a `Lichtenberg figure`_. Even roads between two cities or any
`city network`_ have a fractal structure.

  `Lichtenberg figure`_, `tree branches`_, `x-ray of lungs`_ and `fractal canopy`_
  have very similar structures.


If you're more interesed in fractals in nature, you should visit `the wiki website`_ about fractals.

There is also a good book about rendering plants in L-System: `The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants`_.
